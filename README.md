Credit Card Fraud Detection
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model analyzes transaction data to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activity, helping banks and financial institutions prevent fraud and reduce financial loss.

Dataset
The dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders over two days in September 2013. It consists of 284,807 transactions, including 492 fraudulent cases (~0.172%). The data is highly imbalanced, which poses a challenge for model training.

Features
Time: Seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.

V1 to V28: Anonymized features obtained through PCA to protect sensitive information.

Amount: Transaction amount.

Class: Target variable (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraudulent).

Approaches and Algorithms
The project explores various machine learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

Handling Imbalanced Data
Several techniques are used to address class imbalance:

Random Oversampling

Random Undersampling

Tomek Links Undersampling

Cluster Centroids Undersampling

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

SMOTE combined with Tomek Links

Installation Requirements
